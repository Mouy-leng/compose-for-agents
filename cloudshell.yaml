  Welcome to the Compose for Agents Demos!

  Each directory contains a self-contained demo using Docker Compose and MCP.
  To run a demo:
  1. cd <demo-directory>
  2. docker compose up --build

  Tip: If you're running in Cloud Shell, consider using OpenAI models or
  Docker Offload, as local LLMs may exceed the available RAM.
